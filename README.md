relaypi
=======

Raspberry Pi focused django application for controlling GPIO

Mostly a default Django application. This is mainly ment to be used as a web services for calling from other apps, but could be extended.
I am using a sqlite database and very little/no styling. 

I am (for now) running the webserver using the django dev server with supervisor. I should change this when I get around to it, but since this is only on my internal network, it can wait.
